# Kev Bay's Portfolio

Welcome to the repository of my portfolio page.

On my portfolio page at [kevbay.me](https://kevbay.me) I showcase select projects that I have done in my free time, during my time at Kellogg or in through other ventures.

The portfolio is built with Gatsby and hosted on Netlify. It was designed based on a starter by [Jacobo Martinez](https://github.com/cobidev/gatsby-simplefolio/blob/master/LICENSE.md).
